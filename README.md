# Simple To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features
 - Add new tasks with a timestamp.
 - Prevent duplicate tasks by checking if the task already exists.
 - Delete tasks using a recycle bin icon (red).
 - Edit tasks using a pen icon (orange).
 - Mark tasks as completed using a tick icon (green).
 - Sort tasks by creation time or alphabetical order.
 - Reorder tasks by dragging them up or down.
 - Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-todo-app-js.git
